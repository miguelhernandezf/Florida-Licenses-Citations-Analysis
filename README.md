# üö¶üöóüìÑ Florida-Licenses-Citations-Analysis

---

### üéØ Objectives

This dashboard aims to visualize important insights from a large, disconnected system of yearly data. Without meaningful analysis, this information remains difficult to interpret limiting its value for decision-makers, policymakers, and the general public 
who rely on it to understand critical driving trends across Florida.

This analytical tool supports informed decision-making for key stakeholders such as the State of Florida, public institutions, insurance companies, and other entities that benefit from understanding licensing behavior and citation overviews and patterns.

### üìö About Data  

---

The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) provides annual reports on driver licenses and traffic citations across the state of Florida. Each file represents a different year and includes raw, tabular data. 

- **Driver Licenses Dataset** contains columns such as `Gender`, `County`, `Licenses`, `Age Brackets`, and `Grand Total`.  
- **Traffic Citations** dataset contains columns such as `Violation Group`, `FHP`, `CityPD`, `ShrfDept`, `Other`, `TotalViol`, `Guilty`, `PD CivilP`, `Adj w/h ClkCt`, `Adj w/h Judge`, `NotGuilty`, `Dism`, `NoliPros`, `TotaDisp` and `DispPend`. 

Thanks to **FLHSMV** for sharing this data.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Data Wrangling

---

#### ETL Process Overview:

Both datasets ‚Äî **Driver Licenses** and **Traffic Citations** ‚Äî required tailored cleaning and transformation before analysis. The process included:  
- Removing null values  
- Filtering out redundant and pre-calculated columns  
- Renaming columns for consistency  
- Resolving inconsistencies like naming differences across files (e.g., "St Johns" vs. "St. Johns")  
- Extracting temporal information (Year) and unifying the schema for multi-year analysis  

---

#### **Driver Licenses Dataset**

All six PDF files (2020‚Äì2025) used for this project had different internal structures, which created inconsistencies during data integration. To solve this, I:

- Converted each file from PDF to Excel manually.
- Standardized the structure by promoting headers and aligning columns across years.
- Removed rows with errors, state-wide totals, and previously calculated grand totals.
- Extracted the year from the file name and duplicated it as a column to enable filtering and cross-referencing.
- Unpivoted the age bracket columns into a single column to facilitate age-based filtering and aggregation.
- Grouped the age values from 15‚Äì20 into a combined bracket to keep consistency with other age ranges.

#### **Traffic Citations Dataset**

The Traffic Citations dataset required custom handling due to being spread across five PDF reports (2020‚Äì2024), each with formatting discrepancies.

To ensure uniformity, I:

- Manually manipulated and converted all PDF files into Excel with a common structure.
- Removed pre-aggregated summary rows and totals that could distort visualizations.
- Standardized column headers across years (e.g., `FHP`, `City PD`, `ShrfDept`, `Other`, `Guilty`, `Dismissed`, `Noli Pros`, etc.).
- Created DAX-based measures such as `Total Citations`, calculated by summing FHP, City PD, Sheriff, and Other columns.
- Cleaned and formatted categorical outcome fields (`Guilty`, `Not Guilty`, `Dismissed`, `Adj w/h Judge`, etc.) to enable accurate distribution tracking.
- Extracted and unified the `Year` column to enable consistent time-based slicing.
- Ensured proper data types for all numeric columns and validated values across all years.

### üß© Data Model

This project uses a star schema data model in Power BI, with the following dimensions:

- **Year**: Unique dimension present in both dataset.
- **County, Gender, and Age Bracket**: For slicing driver license trends.
- **Violation Group and Descripcion Dimension**: Helps to slice Citations trends visuals.

The fact tables are:
- `Driver Licenses` (cleaned & transformed Excel from 6 PDFs)
- `Uniform Traffic Citation Report` (merged 5 years of structured PDF data)

These tables were connected using lookup relationships to enable dynamic filtering and drill-downs.

STAR scheme:

#### üßÆ **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

There are in total 19 DAX calculations in this dashboard. To keep this documentation concise, I will focus on the most impactful and frequently used ones.

#### **Driver Licenses Dataset**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Limitations and Suggestions

- The **Driver Licenses dataset** required significant manual transformation due to inconsistent formatting across years. For better automation and time consistency, maintaining a standardized base format is essential.

- The **Traffic Citations dataset** lacks geographic detail such as county, latitude, or longitude of infractions. Including this information would greatly enhance the ability to cross-analyze both datasets geographically.

- Several **violation outcome labels** like `"Nolle Prosequi"` and `"Adj w/h Judge"` were not self-explanatory and required manual research to interpret, which could affect automation or broader user understanding.

---

### üìä Key Trends Identified

- **License Composition**: The most recent report shows that only **30.27%** of licenses belong to **Senior Drivers (24.03%)** and **Teenage Drivers**, meaning the majority of licenses are held by individuals aged **21‚Äì64**. The data also shows that **females consistently hold more licenses than males** over the years.

- **Year of Decline**: The only year where the `Year-over-Year License Growth` was negative was **2023 vs 2022**. While this doesn‚Äôt confirm a long-term trend, it prompts further investigation into economic or demographic changes during that period.

- **Licensing Concentration**: Driver license issuance is **heavily concentrated in South Florida**, particularly in **Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach** counties, reflecting population density and urban demand.

- **Top Violation ‚Äî SPD POST ZONE**: This continues to be the most cited violation across all years, suggesting either poor speed limit visibility, signage issues, or frequent enforcement focus in these zones.

- **Enforcement Distribution**: The **City Police Departments** issue the majority of citations, followed by the **Florida Highway Patrol (FHP)** and **Sheriff‚Äôs Departments**. This distribution highlights possible variations in local enforcement practices and resource availability.

- **Citation Volume Over Time**: Citations have shown a general upward trend, with the largest increase occurring between **2020 and 2021**, with a **20.64% jump** (~400,000 more citations).

- **Most Common Legal Outcome**: The most frequent resolution for citations is **Dismissal**, indicating patterns in adjudication or possible inefficiencies in case processing.

---

### ‚úÖ Actionable Recommendations

- **Target Educational Campaigns at Common Violations**: Focus awareness initiatives around high-frequency infractions like **SPD POST ZONE** to reduce recurrence through community education and improved signage.

- **Leverage South Florida Licensing Density for Resource Allocation**: Since South Florida is the dominating location in terms of volumen of licenses. It would be efficent to increase the FLHSMV 

- **Review Court Outcomes for Policy Insight**: The trend of rising **Dismissals** could indicate areas for judicial or law enforcement training or reveal flaws in citation issuance.

- **Expand Young Driver Safety Programs**: Given the growing number of **Teenage Drivers**, it‚Äôs vital to support pre-licensing education and defensive driving courses aimed at this age group.

- **Analyze Declining Violations for Replicable Strategies**: Investigate why certain violation types are consistently declining and identify enforcement or policy strategies that could be replicated elsewhere.

- **Enhance Agency Coordination**: Since citations are distributed across various enforcement agencies, establishing **standardized reporting and shared data protocols** could enhance both transparency and strategic planning.
