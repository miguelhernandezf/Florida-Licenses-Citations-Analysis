# üö¶üöóüìÑ Florida-Licenses-Citations-Analysis

---

### üéØ Objectives

This dashboard aims to visualize important insights from a large, disconnected system of yearly data. Without meaningful analysis, this information remains difficult to interpret limiting its value for decision-makers, policymakers, and the general public 
who rely on it to understand critical driving trends across Florida.

This analytical tool supports informed decision-making for key stakeholders such as the State of Florida, public institutions, insurance companies, and other entities that benefit from understanding licensing behavior and citation overviews and patterns.

### üìö About Data  

---

The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) provides annual reports on driver licenses and traffic citations across the state of Florida. Each file represents a different year and includes raw, tabular data. 

- **Driver Licenses Dataset** contains columns such as `Gender`, `County`, `Licenses`, `Age Brackets`, and `Grand Total`.  
- **Traffic Citations** dataset contains columns such as `Violation Group`, `FHP`, `CityPD`, `ShrfDept`, `Other`, `TotalViol`, `Guilty`, `PD CivilP`, `Adj w/h ClkCt`, `Adj w/h Judge`, `NotGuilty`, `Dism`, `NoliPros`, `TotaDisp` and `DispPend`. 

Thanks to **FLHSMV** for sharing this data.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Data Wrangling

---

#### ETL Process Overview:

Both datasets ‚Äî **Driver Licenses** and **Traffic Citations** ‚Äî required tailored cleaning and transformation before analysis. The process included:  
- Removing null values  
- Filtering out redundant and pre-calculated columns  
- Renaming columns for consistency  
- Resolving inconsistencies like naming differences across files (e.g., "St Johns" vs. "St. Johns")  
- Extracting temporal information (Year) and unifying the schema for multi-year analysis  

---

#### **Driver Licenses Dataset**

All six PDF files (2020‚Äì2025) used for this project had different internal structures, which created inconsistencies during data integration. To solve this, I:

- Converted each file from PDF to Excel manually.
- Standardized the structure by promoting headers and aligning columns across years.
- Removed rows with errors, state-wide totals, and previously calculated grand totals.
- Extracted the year from the file name and duplicated it as a column to enable filtering and cross-referencing.
- Unpivoted the age bracket columns into a single column to facilitate age-based filtering and aggregation.
- Grouped the age values from 15‚Äì20 into a combined bracket to keep consistency with other age ranges.

#### **Traffic Citations Dataset**

The Traffic Citations dataset required custom handling due to being spread across five PDF reports (2020‚Äì2024), each with formatting discrepancies.

To ensure uniformity, I:

- Manually manipulated and converted all PDF files into Excel with a common structure.
- Removed pre-aggregated summary rows and totals that could distort visualizations.
- Standardized column headers across years (e.g., `FHP`, `City PD`, `ShrfDept`, `Other`, `Guilty`, `Dismissed`, `Noli Pros`, etc.).
- Created DAX-based measures such as `Total Citations`, calculated by summing FHP, City PD, Sheriff, and Other columns.
- Cleaned and formatted categorical outcome fields (`Guilty`, `Not Guilty`, `Dismissed`, `Adj w/h Judge`, etc.) to enable accurate distribution tracking.
- Extracted and unified the `Year` column to enable consistent time-based slicing.
- Ensured proper data types for all numeric columns and validated values across all years.

### üß© Data Model

This project uses a star schema data model in Power BI, with the following dimensions:

- **Year**: Unique dimension present in both dataset.
- **County, Gender, and Age Bracket**: For slicing driver license trends.
- **Violation Group and Descripcion Dimension**: Helps to slice Citations trends visuals.

The fact tables are:
- `Driver Licenses` (cleaned & transformed Excel from 6 PDFs)
- `Uniform Traffic Citation Report` (merged 5 years of structured PDF data)

These tables were connected using lookup relationships to enable dynamic filtering and drill-downs.

STAR scheme:

#### üßÆ **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

There are in total 19 DAX calculations in this dashboard. To keep this documentation concise, I will focus on the most impactful and frequently used ones.

#### **Driver Licenses Dataset**

### üìä Visualization

---

- Produced a 4-slide interactive dashboard using Power BI

---

#### Slide 1 (Licenses Overview)

This slide gives a general view of the Driver Licenses dataset. All slides follow a consistent layout: slicers at the top, followed by KPIs. These KPIs provide insights such as `Total Licenses`, `Senior Drivers (%)`, `Teenage Drivers (%)`, and `Year-over-Year License Growth`. Below each KPI card, supporting context is displayed for better interpretability.

It includes:
- A line chart showing license trends by gender over the years
- A bar chart showing license volume by age bracket
- A toggle button to switch between visual and tabular views

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Limitations and Suggestions

- The **Driver Licenses dataset** required significant manual transformation due to inconsistent formatting across years. For better automation and time consistency, maintaining a standardized base format is essential.

- The **Traffic Citations dataset** lacks geographic detail such as county, latitude, or longitude of infractions. Including this information would greatly enhance the ability to cross-analyze both datasets geographically.

- Several **violation outcome labels** like `"Nolle Prosequi"` and `"Adj w/h Judge"` were not self-explanatory and required manual research to interpret, which could affect automation or broader user understanding.

---

#### üìä Key Trends Identified

- **Licenses Composition**: The most recent report indicates that only 30.27% of licenses belongs to `Senior Drivers` (24.03%) and `Teenagers Drivers` (%), so the gross of licenses are condensed between 21-64 years and charts shows a constant superiority of quantity
of licenses of females over males over years.

- **Decreasing year**: There is just one year where the `Year-over-Year License Growth` is negative, and it is 2023 vs 2022. With this data we can not make conclutions, but we can investigate or try to understand the context happening in those years.

- **Licensing Concentration**: The highest concentration of issued driver licenses in centered in South Florida, including Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach.

- **Top Violation: SPD POST ZONE**: This remains the most cited violation across years, highlighting potential areas for improved signage or enforcement calibration.

- **Enforcement Distribution**: The majority of citations are issued by **City Police Departments**, followed by **FHP** and **Sheriff‚Äôs Departments**. This reflects resource distribution and possible enforcement gaps.

- **Citations Over Time**: The quantity of citations tends to increase over the years. Being the 2021 vs 2020 the most variant interval, the delta between these years are 20.64%, around 400.000 citations

- **Most Common Court Situation**: Citations tends to finishing up in a `Dismissed` case.

---

#### ‚úÖ Actionable Recommendations

- **Focus Education Campaigns on Most Common Violations**: Direct resources toward educating drivers about top infractions (e.g., SPD POST ZONE) to reduce recurrence.

- **Use Citation Outcome Trends for Judicial Review**: Agencies can assess changes in outcomes (e.g., increasing *Dismissals*) to identify potential inefficiencies or training needs.

- **Support Youth Driver Safety Programs**: Given the rising number of young drivers, it‚Äôs advisable to enhance defensive driving initiatives aimed at new licensees.

- **Explore Root Causes Behind Declining Violation Trends**: Understanding why some infractions are dropping could guide effective replication of enforcement strategies.

- **Improve Interdepartmental Coordination**: As enforcement is distributed among multiple agencies, coordinated data-sharing and unified reporting standards could improve efficiency and analysis.
